Apo possesses the wildest spectrum of environments, and provides an experience for mountaineers that lives up to their expectations from the country’s highest.\n\nThe Kidapawan trail, one of many trails, will take you first to Lake Agko. From there, you will have to cross Marbel river in an unforgettable adventure: you have to cross the river several times by walking through coconut logs without anything to hold for support. Even here, lichens cling on the rocks, and very tall trees rise to the sky. The threat of sudden flashfloods, emphasized by the strong flow of water, will remind the intrepid hiker that he not climbing an ordinary mountain. \n\nAfter three hours of river crossing, you would reach the first campsite, at the Mainit Hot Springs. Here, there is a small pool where you could dip; the water is hot and very soothing. You must reach this campsite before 1500hr, because the next campsite is already Lake Venado, 5-6 hours away. Between the two campsites is a thick forest which you have to cross. Here, two ‘killer trails’ are upcoming: the ’87-degree’ and the ’90-degree’ trail. Each taking around 15 minutes, these trails are known to have taken their toll on climbers. As of 2006, ropes are in place in the ‘90-degrees’ to make it a little bit safer.\n\n",

Balatbat, which is also the beginning of the trail to Sitio Malabnig. The trail is generally straightforward and is not particularly confusing. You can ask locals along the way; there are houses along the way. The trail passes through woodlands. Malabnig Village is the major landmark along the trail, it is actually a community of more than a dozen houses at around 400 MASL, and beyond this lies the trail to the peaks. The first peak, the Front Peak, has an electric post and can serve as a campsite. Then, beyond it and in the same direction lies Two Towers’ Peak (850 MASL) which is easily identifiable with its two communications towers. The Main Peak (960 MASL) is the final peak, forested that you can see from the Main Peak. There is a small, cement landmark that can be regarded as the summit marker. Features of the mountain include the beautiful scenes of farm animals, villages, and pastoral activities along the way. Then, at the top, the whole town of Lobo can be seen, and so is Batangas City and Verde Island south of it, as well as the sea lanes. The downside of Mt. Banoi is that its views, while remarkable, are not that spectacular, and the distance (3 hours travel time) may not justify it as a dayhike venue.

San Andres where hikers need to register first and arrange a guide because it is mandatory to hire. The first 15 minutes crossing the trails with rice fields and will take you to a blue clear water looking cave, then the trail will require to cross a dry river which is huge when rainy season starts. The ascent to the Mapatag Plateau is very easy and quick but be mindful that the hot weather can be dangerous. Mapatag Plateau can be the final endpoint of the hike – it is a grassland slope that serves as a scenic viewpoint and a possible campsite.\n\nIt is possible to go to Susong Dalaga Peak which takes about 2 hours from Mapatag Plateau according to the guides of Mt. Batolusong. Also, a new Peak is open named “Rangyas Peak” which offers the view of the eastern side of the Mountain.\n\n",

Furthermore, there are tales of voices or apparitions, such as the creature called ‘Tumao’, waylaying mountain climbers; many hiking groups have their own \"ghost stories\" to tell. Even locals believe these stories; some guides say they have amulets to counteract the negative energy.\n\nThese legends notwithstanding, there is no reason to be afraid of Mt. Cristobal. Its forests are pristine, with a splendid array of flora that include giant pakpaklawin, varicolored flowering plants, rattan, etc. Two types of civet cats, the musang and the animus, roam freely in the forests. There are also reptile species, including those locally known as the bubuli and the balikakas.\n\n",

The long trek to the peak boasts of a variety of landscapes, starting from the wide trails with pine trees and grassland and progressing into denser and denser jungles. The jungle will reach a point that virtually everything is covered with moss and clouds. The trees are like bonsai, with spiraling, convoluted branches and lichen and white moss that give an ‘ancient’ feel to the forest. The temperature goes down even in daytime, and when you emerge from this jungle to the clearing at the peak, you can behold the whole of the Kitanglad range and even catch a glimpse of majestic Mt. Apo.\n\nDulang-Dulang, like Pulag and Apo, is sacred to the locals. The Talaandig tribe of Lantapan have been accorded rights to the mountains as their \"ancestral domains\". Hence it is a must to secure their blessing to climb Mt. Dulang-Dulang. It is said that they limit the climbers to groups of 20, although this demand is somewhat negotiable. Nevertheless, a ritual sacrifice of chickens is done before every climb by the datu, and climbers perform the ritual of hanging bands of white cloth at the summit, as respect to the native culture.

                    Background ="Mt. Guiting-Guiting, one of the most difficult climbs located in Sibuyan Island, Romblon. The mountain is rated Difficulty: 9/9 because of the steep and jagged ridges of the mountain called \"Knife Edge\" which hikers must cross in order to reach the summit, not to mention the ensuing rock formations with colorful names such as \"Kiss the Wall\". On top of this challenging trail, the weather is so volatile that hikers would use absolute cut-off times to reach the summit, otherwise they would have to turn back. By implication, only hikers with enough stamina are advised to attempt to hike this mountain.\n\nIn May 1982, a combined team of the Philippine Mountaineering Society (PMS) of Bacolod City and UP Mountaineers did the first exploration of the mountain, reaching the then-unnamed Mayo’s Peak but failing to reach the summit. A few weeks later, some of them returned to make the first ascent to Mt. Guiting-Guiting summit.\n\nEven without the accomplishment of getting to the summit of Mt. Guiting-Guiting, a visit to the Sibuyan Island is already amazing and rewarding enough. To begin with, Sibuyan Island is a jewel of the seas. 187 nautical miles from Manila, the 445-sq.km island has beaches, waterfalls, and one of the cleanest rivers in the Philippines. The mountain has been called the most diverse forest in the world being the habitat of up to 54 endemic plant varieties, and home to fascinating endemic flora and fauna. These include four species of rodents and a kind of bat discovered only in the mid-1990s and found nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe climb takes three days to finish, Day 1 is the hike up to Mayo’s Peak (1550 MASL). Three streams will be crossed before reaching Camp 1, and three camps will be passed (Camp 1-3) before reaching Mayo’s Peak. The trails are surrounded by woodlands throughout the hike. Normally, Day 2 is the 4-5 hr ascend to the summit and including back. A fast descent from Mayo’s Peak will lead to the \"Knife Edge\" – here the entire trail is rocky and exposed to the sun and winds; there are ravines on both sides and the view is both breathtaking and scary. After 3-4 hrs, the Peak of Deception, an imposing sight, will be reached. They say this peak was also called \"Peak of Decision\" because from here you will have to decide whether to proceed or not, considering the time and one’s energy, and from here, it’s only 30-45 minutes away from the summit itself. The trails here are unforgiving. After passing this trail, hikers can now reach the summit. At the summit, when it is clear, you can see the neighboring peaks of the Guiting-Guiting range, as well as the seas surrounding Sibuyan Island.\n\n	The third and final day is the descent back to Magdiwang. As you leave Sibuyan Island by ferry, the towering presence of Guiting-Guiting and its saw-toothed peaks will remind you of the unforgettable adventure.\n\n",

If going there directly, best arrive on weekdays and allow on extra day for contingencies.\n\nDuring rainy season, climbing may have to be aborted when flash floods sets in making the trail crossing rivers unpassable.

La Union in San Isidro, Davao Oriental. A whole-day trek to either Kapatagan Uno (first camp) or all the way to Kapatagan Dos (second campsite; near the summit) is typically done. The first two hours require river crossing, in a background of woodlands. Followed by the second day which is mostly for exploring the beautiful pygmy forest, the summit, and the mysterious ‘Tinagong Dagat’. Also, near the bonsai fields lie the narrow but high Twin Falls.\n\nBefore reaching Camp 3, a vantage point known as ‘Lantawan’ will be encountered – affording spectacular views of the Hamiguitan range as well as the southern seas, including Pujada bay. Pitcher plants and large ferns dominate the scene, as well as dense mossy patches. On the third day, one may descend via the same route but there is the option of descending via Gov. Generoso town.

It is so popular that on weekends and summer months that the mountain is receive too many impacts and visitors. The mountain is located at the heart of Cuenca, Batangas that it is easily identifiable because of its form and breathtaking to everybody else especially the visitors. The mountain has three parts or destination that hikers usually visit: the famous Rockies (760m), the summit (930m) and the Grotto (510m). These can be covered by a traverse dayhike, but most hikers head to the Rockies because of its beautiful, breathtaking scenery which is the reason why many of them took pictures, posing in the rocking in that place. Only 5% of hikers pursue the traverse which will walk the whole mountain trail from different starting point until reaching the other side.\n\nIt is understandable, though, that the Rockies is Maculot’s most powerful draw or the most popular place in the mountain that caught the attention of the beginner hikers. This rocky formation stands beside Taal Lake including the worlds famous Taal Volcano; as well as the plains of Batangas. In the Summit you can see the other mountains of Batangas: Mt. Makiling, Malipunyo mountain ranges and Tagaytay Highlands. The climbing time is variable; experienced hikers can reach the Rockies in less than an hour, but on a more relaxed pace, one could take up to two or three hours.\nFrom the summit of Maculot, there are two trails: one that follows the trail of the origin, and another than goes down right from the summit. This goes to the Grotto where hikers can experience the steep trail land roped segment of the mountain. The forest ends where the Grotto emerges, and the Grotto has Stations of the Cross that follows to reach the end of the trail.\n\n",

They named it \"Pico De Loro\" – Parrot’s Peak. Today, mountaineers who visit Pico De Loro discover that it is as enchanting as its name. High on Cavite’s highest point, they could behold the rocky tower that the Spanish sailors once saw as the parrot’s beak, and they could gaze towards South China Sea where the galleons once sailed, all the way to the historic island fort of Corregidor. Gusts of sea breeze reach the peak, refreshing hikers after a four-hour climb. The peak’s rocky outcropping is dramatic, and sharply contrasts with the plains of Cavite and the waters of South China Sea.\n\nHikers choose this also as the most popular mountain to hike near Manila. Pico De Loro is located on a DENR Protected Area. Which is also the location of different kinds of destination like Puerto Azul and Caylabne and also the famous Kaybiang tunnel. Readily accessible by bus from Coastal Mall, that’s why it is a perfect weekend getaway. Even during the dry season, its forests protect hikers from the sun. Sometimes hikers can even chance upon exotic birds and monkeys along the trail.\nThe trail now is made by the DENR which they proposed that hikers can walk through the mountain in just 2 hrs compared to the old trail that is now closed for rehabilitation of the forest. The summit campsite is surrounded by bamboos and some nice trees. There is also a part of the campsite that is part of a ridge that overlooks the summit.From the summit, there is an opportunity to scale the Parrot’s Beak – more popularly known as the ‘Monolith’ which is the centerpiece of the views at the top. This is a 5-10 minute descent-then-ascent, then a brief scramble that can be quite dangerous.\nThe mountain has also traverse trails, the option to go down via Nasugbu, Batangas or go back to Ternate Highway, which cuts the trail for 30-60 minutes. Pico De Loro is one of the best dayhikes for outdoor activities.\n\n",

It is a surprisingly wondrous mountain on its own right, with verdant cogon grass during the rainy season, and a challenging 60° trail before the peak. The name Talamitam came from the talamitam trees that used to grow on its slopes - this is a reminder that the mountain had a lush vegetation and untarnished ecosystems in the past. Today Mt. Talamitam is a bald mountain, but efforts are underway to rehabilitate the peak with tree planting and other initiatives.\n\nThe trail starts at the end of the rough road going down to a river, from here a short woodland hike would connect hikers to a grassland slope that has sparse vegetation. The mountain has many trail variations, most of them leading to the plateau where the peak of Mt. Talamitam sits. The trail is easy hikers can just follow whichever the trail leads until they reach the peak. Ascending the summit takes about 20-30 minutes due to steep and sometimes hot because of the open trails, also the tall grasses that can slow hikers down, especially during the rainy season.\nGoing back takes less than an hour, take note that when descending the mountain the trails may lead you to other villages nearby, and make sure to remember it before hiking.

                    Background ="Mt. Victoria is an unexplored and wild destination for hikers who seeks adventure, with its unbelievable array of flora and fauna just starting to be discovered. In this mountain a \"spectacular\" rat-eating pitcher plant was discovered creating a global sensation for scientists and media alike. It has since been named Nepenthes attenboroughii and is just one of the species that are beginning to be unraveled in this mountain paradise. Plus this mountain is home to the native Tagbanua tribe.\n\nThe terrain of Mt. Victoria is diverse, exciting, and therefore a treat to the hikers. To start with, a biodiversity of its magnitude can only be nourished by an abundance of water. Hence the numerous water forms in Mt. Victoria: streams, waterfalls, and even lagoons. You can only imagine the unexplored species lurking in these hidden lakes. For their part, mountaineers have to cross these streams and falls, Indeed \"80% of the trail involves crossing major and minor rivers\". Other destinations waiting to be explored include Atong Peak, and Sultan Peak, and countless other nameless peaks of the Victoria Range.\nThe ascent to the summit of Mt. Victoria is challenging, a minimum of four days is required to do the hike. As mentioned, the hike heavily involves river crossings and the trails are mostly steep, and would oftentimes involve bouldering. Aside from the biodiversity and the tribes; the summit shows the views of South China Sea and Sulu Sea, the neighboring peaks and mountains.\n",
